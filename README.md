Dictionary learning for ChIA-Drop experiments with online convex matrix factorization

This is a repository for the paper "Online Convex Network Dictionary Learning for Inferring Chromatin Interactions."

The algorithm has two major components: an MCMC-based network subsampling and an iterative optimization to learn the dictionary. 

## Example with Synthetic Data

 We provide synthetic data generated by the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) for verification. To run just the optimization step for quick verification on the synthetic dataset, use
```
source run_example.sh
```
### Details of the pipeline

1. Raw data in the form of lists of edges for various SBM networks can be found in the sub-folder 'sampling\Data\synthetic\'. The sbm2 network file is plotted below

2. To run the MCMC sampling procedure, use the script 'sampling\generate_synthetic_samples.py'. The sampled data is stored in the folder 'processed_data\synthetic'.
