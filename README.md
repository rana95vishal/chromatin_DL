Dictionary learning for ChIA-Drop experiments with online convex matrix factorization

This is a repository for the paper "Online Convex Network Dictionary Learning for Inferring Chromatin Interactions."

The algorithm has two major components: an MCMC-based network subsampling and an iterative optimization to learn the dictionary. The 

## Example with Synthetic Data

 We provide synthetic data generated by the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) for quick verification.
