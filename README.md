Dictionary learning for ChIA-Drop experiments with online convex matrix factorization

This is a repository for the paper "Online Convex Network Dictionary Learning for Inferring
Chromatin Interactions."

## Example with Synthetic Data

The algorithm has two major components: an MCMC-based network subsampling and an iterative optimization to learn the dictionary.

## Packages
The following packages are needed to run the code
```
python=3.8
pandas
matplotlib
ipdb
tqdm
scikit-learn
k-means-constrained
cvxpy
networkx
tensorly
psutil
```
